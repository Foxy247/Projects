//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = [
    'Die Gefährten', 
    'Die zwei Türme', 
    'Die Rückkehr des Königs'
]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
firstMovie = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const newMovies = movies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const lastMovie = movies[2]
